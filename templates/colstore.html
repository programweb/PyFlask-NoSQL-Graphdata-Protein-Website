<h2>Use of Column Store DB</h2>
<p><i>Column-Store Database Demo</i>
<ul>
<li><b>MariaDB</b> - One of the most popular columnar databases available is 
  MariaDB. It was created as a fork of MySQL intended to be robust and scalable, 
  handle many different purposes and a large volume of queries.
  MariaDB ColumnStore is a columnar storage engine that utilizes a massively 
  parallel distributed data architecture.
  
<li><b>Apache Druid</b> in Docker - 
  Fast column-oriented distributed data store.<br>
  Druid is a NoSQL database but rather than a 'document store' it is a 'wide column store'<br>
  <span style=color:blue>Could do this if whole thing is NoSQL databases.</span>
  <br>A
  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide-column_store' target='_blank'>wide-column
    store</a> (or extensible record store) is a type of NoSQL database. 
  It uses tables, rows, and columns, but unlike a relational database, the names 
  and format of the columns can vary from row to row in the same table.<br>

<li><b>Apache HBase</b> - Apache HBase is a column-oriented, NoSQL database 
  built on top of Hadoop (HDFS, to be exact). It is an open source 
  implementation of Google's Bigtable paper.
<li> Some Column Oriented Databases may be NoSQL and some may not be.
<li><b>Apache Cassandra</b> (column-oriented database) is a free and open-source, distributed, wide-column store, 
  NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of
  data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no 
  single point of failure.
  
  A wide-column store (or extensible record store) is a type of NoSQL database. 
  It uses tables, rows, and columns, but unlike a relational database, the names and 
  format of the columns can vary from row to row in the same table. 
  A wide-column store can be interpreted as a two-dimensional keyâ€“value store.
  
  In genuine column stores, a columnar data layout is adopted such that each 
  column is stored separately on disk. Wide-column stores do often support the 
  notion of column families that are stored separately. However, each such 
  column family typically contains multiple columns that are used together, 
  similar to traditional relational database tables. Within a given column 
  family, all data is stored in a row-by-row fashion, such that the columns for 
  a given row are stored together, rather than each column being stored 
  separately. Wide-column stores that support column families are also known as 
  column family databases.
  
<li> Good tutorial but this part is for installation of Casandra:
  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cassandra/cassandra_installation.htm
<li class=warn> Java is the main prerequisite for Cassandra.
  
<li> Logging ?
<li> User database ?
<li> If col store too much of a hassle consider putting NumPy or SciPy2 here instead!
<li> Faster because&hellip; 
A columnar database is faster and more efficient than a traditional database 
because the data storage is by columns rather than by rows. ... Column oriented 
databases have faster query performance because the column design keeps data 
closer together, which reduces seek time.
<li> NoSQL databases are often better suited to storing and modeling structured, 
  semi-structured, and unstructured data in one database.
