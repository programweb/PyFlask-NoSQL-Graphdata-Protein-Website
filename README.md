# PyFlask-NoSQL-GraphData-Protein-Website
Python/Flask website in a Docker container. MongoDB, Neo4J, graph databases, NoSQL Document Type database, graph/network data, etc. Fairly decent Flask templating, includes, static files, macros (like functions for templates).  **NetworkX is used for Network Analysis in Python**

I was interested in protein interaction network data structures fetched by tapping into webservice endpoints and visualized with NetworkX. I also became interested in various NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Neo4j, etc. â€” they can be beneficial in some situations; although SQL and relational databases are the standard for good reasons.).  So, I used them in this project together with Python and some libraries.

I got interested in the NoSQL databases after reading even the first 3-5 chapters in this book.

I DID NOT ADD ALL THE IMAGES IN STATIC/IMAGES/PROTEIN.
&nbsp;

Github was kind of complaining about the amount of files I was adding.  

You can get them off the internet.
&nbsp;

I used wget to bring them all down automatically locally - from a selected set of approved gene names in my protein database table.
&nbsp;

This may be missing a critical file(s).  Sorry about that.  I did this a while back.
