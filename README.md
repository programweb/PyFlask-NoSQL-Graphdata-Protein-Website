# PyFlask-NoSQL-GraphData-Protein-Website
Python/Flask website in a Docker container. MongoDB, Neo4J, graph databases, NoSQL Document Type database, graph/network data, etc. Fairly decent Flask templating, includes, static files, macros (like functions for templates).

I DID NOT ADD ALL THE IMAGES IN STATIC/IMAGES/PROTEIN.

Github was kind of complaining about the amount of files I was adding.

You can get them off the internet.

I used wget to bring them all down automatically locally - from a selected set of approved gene names in my protein database table.
